## **rdump: Project Handoff & Technical Specification**

**Version:** 1.1.0 (Feature-Complete Core)
**Date:** July 5, 2024
**Lead Collaborator:** You

### **1. Motivation & Vision: The "Why"**

#### **1.1 The Problem: The Developer-to-LLM "Context Gap"**

In the current landscape of AI-assisted development, a significant bottleneck exists in providing Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents with relevant context from a codebase. The standard workflow is a painful, manual ritual:

1.  Use `ls` to explore the directory structure.
2.  Use `find` with complex, often-forgotten syntax to locate potentially relevant files.
3.  Use `grep` or `ripgrep` to see if those files contain specific keywords.
4.  Finally, use `cat` to dump the contents of the discovered files into a single, massive text blob to be pasted into a prompt.

This process is slow, error-prone, and produces a low-quality result. The final output is an **unstructured firehose of text** that is noisy, lacks clear file boundaries, and often exceeds the LLM's context window with irrelevant boilerplate, comments, and imports. For an autonomous AI agent, navigating this workflow is even more difficult, requiring dozens of brittle, trial-and-error shell commands.

#### **1.2 The Solution: `rdump` - ETL for Code Context**

`rdump` was conceived to solve this problem by being a purpose-built tool for **Extracting, Transforming, and Loading** code context for language models. It bridges the "context gap" by providing a single, powerful interface to find and aggregate relevant information.

Its core strengths are:

*   **An Expressive Query Language:** Instead of arcane shell commands, `rdump` offers an intuitive, SQL-like query language (`ext:rs & (contains:'foo' | name:'*_test.rs')`) that is easy for both humans and AI agents to read, write, and generate.
*   **High-Performance Search:** Built in Rust and powered by parallel processing (`rayon`) and intelligent file discovery (`ignore`), `rdump` is designed to be exceptionally fast, even on large codebases.
*   **Structured, Agent-Ready Output:** The output is not just a text blob. It is structured (Markdown, JSON) to preserve file boundaries and metadata, making it far more useful for an LLM to reason about the provided context.

#### **1.3 Use Cases**

**For Human Developers:**

*   **Rapid Context Grabbing:** Quickly generate a context blob for a prompt: `rdump "path:src/api/ & (def:User | def:Order)" > context.txt`
*   **Codebase Exploration:** Answer complex questions about a new codebase instantly: "Find all TOML files or YAML files that mention 'database'": `rdump "(ext:toml | ext:yml) & contains:database"`
*   **Impact Analysis:** Before a refactor, find all files that import a specific module and are larger than 2kb: `rdump "import:old_module & size:>2kb"`

**For AI Agents / LLMs:**

`rdump` is designed to be the **primary file interaction tool for an AI agent**. Instead of teaching an agent to fumble with `ls`, `grep`, and `cat`, you can give it a single, powerful tool.

*   **Task:** "Refactor the `Database` class."
*   **Without `rdump`:** The agent runs `ls -R`, gets a huge list, tries `grep -r Database .`, gets thousands of results including variable names, then tries to `cat` a few likely-looking files. This is slow and inefficient.
*   **With `rdump`:** The agent can be prompted to generate a single command:
    `rdump --format=json "def:Database"`
    This one command returns a perfect, structured JSON object containing only the file(s) where the `Database` class or struct is defined. The agent can then parse this JSON and proceed with the task, having acquired perfect context in a single step.

### **2. The v2.0 Roadmap: Code-Aware Intelligence**

The current version of `rdump` is a powerful text-search tool. The next major phase is to transform it into a **language-aware code query engine**. The goal is to allow queries that understand the semantic structure of code, not just the characters it contains.

#### **2.1 The Vision: Semantic Search**

Users should be able to ask questions about the code's structure directly.

*   "Find the definition of the `Cli` struct in my Rust code."
    *   `rdump "def:Cli & ext:rs"`
*   "Show me all Python functions named `process_data`."
    *   `rdump "func:process_data & ext:py"`
*   "List all JavaScript files that import the `react` library."
    *   `rdump --format=paths "import:react & (ext:js | ext:tsx)"`

#### **2.2 Core Technology: `tree-sitter`**

To achieve this, we will integrate the `tree-sitter` parser generator library. `tree-sitter` is the ideal choice because it is:
*   **Fast:** Designed for real-time use in text editors.
*   **Robust:** It can gracefully handle syntax errors, producing a partial syntax tree even for incomplete code.
*   **Multi-Language:** It has a vast library of mature grammars for dozens of programming languages.

#### **2.3 The Architectural Plan: A Pluggable Abstraction Layer**

A direct implementation faces a major challenge that you correctly identified: the names for concepts like "function" or "class" are different in every language's `tree-sitter` grammar (`function_item` in Rust, `function_definition` in Python, etc.).

Our architecture will solve this with a **Language Profile Abstraction Layer**.

1.  **Universal Predicates:** We will define a set of universal `rdump` predicates (`def`, `func`, `import`, etc.).
2.  **`LanguageProfile` Struct:** For each supported language, we will create a `LanguageProfile` that maps our universal predicate names to the specific `tree-sitter` query for that language.

    *A conceptual example:*
    ```rust
    // Python Profile
    queries: {
        "def": "(class_definition name: (identifier) @match)",
        "func": "(function_definition name: (identifier) @match)"
    }

    // Rust Profile
    queries: {
        "def": "[(struct_item name: (identifier) @match) (enum_item name: (identifier) @match)]",
        "func": "(function_item name: (identifier) @match)"
    }
    ```

3.  **`CodeAwareEvaluator` Plugin:** We will create a new, smart `PredicateEvaluator` "plugin". When it evaluates a query like `def:Cli` on a `.rs` file, it will:
    a. Look up the Rust `LanguageProfile`.
    b. Get the `tree-sitter` query string associated with the `"def"` key.
    c. Parse the file using the Rust `tree-sitter` grammar.
    d. Execute the query against the resulting syntax tree.
    e. Check if any of the nodes captured by `@match` have the text `Cli`.

This design is highly modular and extensible. To add support for a new language, we simply need to write its `LanguageProfile` and add the `tree-sitter` grammar crate; no changes to the core evaluator logic will be needed.

#### **2.4 Phased Implementation Plan**

We will build this ambitious feature incrementally.

1.  **Phase 2.0 (Core Integration):** Implement the `def`, `func`, and `import` predicates for a **single language: Rust**. This will prove the architecture and provide immediate value.
2.  **Phase 2.1 (Expansion):** Add support for **Python**. This will validate the extensibility of our `LanguageProfile` design.
3.  **Phase 2.2 (Further Expansion):** Add support for other major languages like JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, etc., and consider new predicates like `call:<NAME>`.

This roadmap provides a clear path to transforming `rdump` into a next-generation developer tool, purpose-built for the age of AI-assisted programming.
