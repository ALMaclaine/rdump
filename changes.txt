You have made an excellent observation, and you are absolutely correct. The single-file approach has served its purpose in building the initial features, but we have now reached a point where it's becoming a significant maintainability bottleneck. The files are too large, making changes difficult to review and increasing the amount of code I need to output for even minor modifications.

It is time for a strategic refactoring. We will adopt Rust's idiomatic directory-based module system to break these large files into smaller, more focused units.

### **Proposed File Modularization Strategy**

Here is the plan to restructure the most problematic areas of our codebase.

#### **1. The `predicates` Module**

This is the biggest offender. It currently contains the trait, all concrete evaluators, and all unit tests in one massive file.

**New Structure:**

```
src/predicates/
├── mod.rs               # The main module file. Declares sub-modules and the registry.
├── code_aware.rs        # Unchanged for now, will be its own directory next.
├── contains.rs          # ContainsEvaluator and its tests.
├── ext.rs               # ExtEvaluator and its tests.
├── helpers.rs           # Shared helper functions like parse_and_compare_size.
├── matches.rs           # MatchesEvaluator and its tests.
├── modified.rs          # ModifiedEvaluator and its tests.
├── name.rs              # NameEvaluator and its tests.
├── path.rs              # PathEvaluator and its tests.
└── size.rs              # SizeEvaluator and its tests.
```

**Changes:**
*   Each simple predicate (`ext`, `name`, `size`, etc.) will be moved into its own file.
*   Each file will contain the `struct` definition, the `impl PredicateEvaluator`, and its own small, focused `#[cfg(test)]` block.
*   The shared helper functions for `size` and `modified` will move to `predicates/helpers.rs`.
*   The main `predicates/mod.rs` will shrink dramatically. Its only jobs will be to declare the sub-modules (`pub mod ext;`, `pub mod name;`, etc.) and contain the `create_predicate_registry` function, which assembles all the evaluators.

---

#### **2. The `code_aware` Sub-module**

This is our second-worst offender and is guaranteed to grow with each new language.

**New Structure:**

```
src/predicates/code_aware/
├── mod.rs               # Holds the CodeAwareEvaluator struct and its logic.
└── profiles/
    ├── mod.rs           # Declares all language profiles and assembles them.
    ├── javascript.rs    # create_javascript_profile()
    ├── python.rs        # create_python_profile()
    ├── rust.rs          # create_rust_profile()
    └── typescript.rs    # create_typescript_profile()
```

**Changes:**
*   The `predicates/code_aware.rs` file will become a directory.
*   The `CodeAwareEvaluator` struct and its `impl PredicateEvaluator` will live in `predicates/code_aware/mod.rs`.
*   All `create_*_profile()` functions will be moved into their own files inside a new `profiles` sub-directory.
*   The `lazy_static` map of language profiles will be assembled in `profiles/mod.rs` and used by `code_aware/mod.rs`. This makes adding a new language as simple as adding one file and one line to `profiles/mod.rs`.

---

#### **3. The Integration Tests**

Our single `tests/code_aware_search.rs` file is also becoming a monolith.

**New Structure:**

```
tests/
├── common.rs            # The shared setup_test_project() helper function.
├── js_ts_search.rs      # Integration tests specifically for JS/TS.
├── python_search.rs     # Integration tests specifically for Python.
└── rust_search.rs       # Integration tests specifically for Rust.
```

**Changes:**
*   Rust's test runner automatically treats every file in the `tests/` directory as a separate integration test crate.
*   We will move the `setup_test_project()` helper into `tests/common.rs`.
*   Each language-specific test file (`rust_search.rs`, etc.) will import the helper using `mod common;` and contain only the tests relevant to that language.

---

This refactoring will make the project significantly more maintainable and scalable. Any future changes will be smaller, more targeted, and easier for both of us to manage.

If this modularization strategy meets your approval, I am ready to generate the first set of refactoring changes, starting with the `predicates` module.
